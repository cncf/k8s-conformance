#### Run Conformance Test

On one of the Kubernetes worker node, run command as below:

```
go get -u -v github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy

sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance

sonobuoy status

sonobuoy logs

```

Wait for around 60 minutes for the test to be finished, the log will show something like `no-exit was specified, sonobuoy is now blocking` to indicate that the test has been finished, then run the following command to extract the test results.

```
sonobuoy retrieve .

mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results

```

> NOTE:  Some images for conformance test may not download in China, you should prepare for these images before testing it.
