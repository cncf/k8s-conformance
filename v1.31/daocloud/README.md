### DaoCloud Enterprise

DaoCloud Enterprise is a platform based on Kubernetes which developed by [DaoCloud](https://www.daocloud.io).

### How to Reproduce

#### Create Cluster

First install [DaoCloud Enterprise](https://docs.daocloud.io/install/offline-install-full/), and login to the console.
After successful login, select "Clusters > create" and config the create page.
The "Clusters" page will display all the clusters created and managed by DaoCloud Enterprise.

#### Run conformance Test by Sonobuoy

Login to the control-plant of the cluster created by DaoCloud Enterprise.

Start the conformance tests:

```
wget https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/releases/download/v0.56.16/sonobuoy_0.56.16_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf sonobuoy_0.56.16_linux_amd64.tar.gz
mv sonobuoy /usr/local/bin
sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance

````

Monitor the conformance tests by tracking the sonobuoy logs, and wait for the line: "no-exit was specified, sonobuoy is now blocking"

```
sonobuoy logs -f

```

Retrieve result:

```
outfile=$(sonobuoy retrieve)
mkdir ./results;
tar -xzf $outfile -C ./results
```
