To create the cluster:

We take full responsibility for creating, updating, and managing your Kubernetes clusters. Once the cluster is set up, we provide you with a kubeconfig file that grants you secure access to the cluster.

Please send an e-mail to sales-staff.de@wiit.cloud to create a Kubernetes cluster.

Once the cluster is created, you will receive a kubeconfig admin via a secure method, as well as a unique cluster ID.

```
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig-admin-<CLUSTERID>
```

If you have any issues please email sales-staff.de@wiit.cloud
