Only set when deletionTimestamp is also\n     set. May only be shortened. Read-only.\n\n   deletionTimestamp\t<string>\n     DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be\n     deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is\n     requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The\n     resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists,\n     and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the\n     finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items,\n     deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not\n     be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or\n     the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may\n     request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by\n     sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After\n     that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL)\n     to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the\n     presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this\n     timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the\n     resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object\n     has not been requested.\n\n     Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.\n     More info:\n     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata\n\n   finalizers\t<[]string>\n     Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is\n     an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from\n     the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in\n     this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in\n     any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of\n     stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission\n     can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can\n     lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first\n     finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external\n     system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later\n     in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers\n     are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering\n     changes in the list.\n\n   generateName\t<string>\n     GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a\n     unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is\n     used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name\n     passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided\n     value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated\n     by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the\n     server.\n\n     If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will\n     NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with\n     Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the\n     time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time\n     indicated in the Retry-After header).\n\n     Applied only if Name is not specified. More info:\n     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency\n\n   generation\t<integer>\n     A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.\n     Populated by the system. Read-only.\n\n   labels\t<map[string]string>\n     Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize\n     (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers\n     and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels\n\n   managedFields\t<[]Object>\n     ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are\n     managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and\n     users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow\n     can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific\n     apply path like \"ci-cd\". The set of fields is always in the version that\n     the workflow used when modifying the object.\n\n   name\t<string>\n     Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating\n     resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the\n     generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended\n     for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated.\n     More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names\n\n   namespace\t<string>\n     Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty\n     namespace is equivalent to the \"default\" namespace, but \"default\" is the\n     canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a\n     namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.\n\n     Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info:\n     http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces\n\n   ownerReferences\t<[]Object>\n     List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have\n     been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is\n     managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this\n     controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more\n     than one managing controller.\n\n   resourceVersion\t<string>\n     An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that\n     can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used\n     for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a\n     resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and\n     passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a\n     particular resource or set of resources.\n\n     Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by\n     clients and . More info:\n     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency\n\n   selfLink\t<string>\n     SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system.\n     Read-only.\n\n     DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and\n     the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.\n\n   uid\t<string>\n     UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically\n     generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not\n     allowed to change on PUT operations.\n\n     Populated by the system. Read-only. More info:\n     http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids\n\n"
