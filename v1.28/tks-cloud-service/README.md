## Cloud Account Configuration

First, you should login tks (https://tks-console.sktenterprise.com/login)

You need to create a Cloud Account to create a public cloud environment where Stack is installed.
TKS currently supports AWS.
Stack is a term used in TKS and includes both Kuberentes and services and add-ons for operation.

Click the settings menu represented by the gear icon on the top menu bar, and then select Cloud Account on the right menu bar.

When you click the Create button, the cloud account creation window will appear.
Since the only public cloud currently provided is AWS, enter the necessary information based on AWS.

In order to obtain the information required for input, you must do the following in your AWS Account in advance.

1. Create IAM User
2. Assign AdministratorAccess Policy on the IAM User
3. Creat Access Key Pair (ID/Secret)
4. Create Pulbic Key pair
   . The key pair is used to create EC2 instance for SSH
   . pem key name must set to "tks-seoul"

TKS uses the customer's AWS Access Key to create and use an AWS Assume Role to create and manage AWS resources.

Assume Role is a temporary credential method provided by AWS and is a highly secure method that can be used without storing the customer's key.
After creation, the Secret Access Key is exposed only once, so please store and manage it well.

## Create Stack

Click the Create button.

1. Environment setting
   After entering management information such as the stack name, select AWS as the installation environment.
   Click the Next button.

2. Select Stack Template

   Click the Next button.

   Set up a pre-created Cloud Account and enter the number of EC2 instances the user will use.
   Click the Check Available Resources button to check whether the selected Cloud Account has sufficient resources.
