All hosts are assumed to be CentOS or RHEL or SLES OS.
Assume that user has HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise software installed on 'controller' host.
Please follow the documentation [here](https://docs.ezmeral.hpe.com/runtime-enterprise/56/) to understand more about deploying ERE and creating the kubernetes cluster.

- Wait for the cluster to be in 'ready state'. This might take a while.

### Run Sonobuoy tests on the newly-created cluster
- From terminal on your machine, ssh into the k8s cluster master node with the user/password you've setup in prior step.
- mkdir /root/bin
- curl -L "https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/releases/download/v0.57.1/sonobuoy_0.57.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz" --output $HOME/bin/sonobuoy.tar.gz && tar -xzf $HOME/bin/sonobuoy.tar.gz -C $HOME/bin && chmod +x $HOME/bin/sonobuoy && rm $HOME/bin/sonobuoy.tar.gz
- sonobuoy delete --all --wait
- sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance --wait
- sonobuoy status (until status shown as completed)
- sonobuoy retrieve (will give you <OUTPUT.tgz> file)
- sonobuoy results <OUTPUT.tgz>
- sonobuoy delete --all --wait

### Delete the cluster
