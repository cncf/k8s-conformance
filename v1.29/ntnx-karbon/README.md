Nutanix Kubernetes Engine
===
 To Reproduce
---
 On Nutanix Prism Central, enable Kubernetes (managed Kubernetes offering of Nutanix) by following
the instructions mentioned below:
1. Log on to Prism Central.
2. Click the menu icon.
3. In the Services option, click Kubernetes.
4. `Kubernetes is successfully enabled` message will indicate that Kubernetes has been enabled successfully.
5. In the Kubernetes Console, a message directs you to download a node OS image.
6. Once image download completes successfully, use the UI cluster create wizard
   to fill up all the necessary information:
     a) Name of cluster
     b) Network to be used.
     c) Choose development cluster or production cluster.
     d) Select 1.29.x as the K8s version to be deployed.
     e) Select the storage container.
     f) Initiate cluster creation.
     g) UI will display the status of deployment.

Next, follow the steps to install a fresh cluster, choosing `v1.29` as the Kubernetes
version and `centos` as the base image.

Once the cluster is deployed, you can download the kubeconfig to your local machine using
the steps described:
1. In the Clusters view, select a cluster from the list by checking the adjacent box.
2. Click the Actions drop-down.
3. Click Download Kubeconfig
4. Under Instructions, click Download.
5. Once the file is downloaded(example: prod1-kubectl.cfg), run the following command:
    `export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/prod1-kubectl.cfg`
6. Run the following command to test the cluster:
    `kubectl cluster-info`

Then, build Sonobuoy(the standard tool for running these tests) by running `go get -u -v github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy`.
This would build the latest Sonobuoy release [v0.56.8](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/releases/tag/v0.56.8).

Deploy a Sonobuoy pod to the deployed cluster using `sonobuoy run`, which will initiate the tests to run on
the cluster. Use `sonobuoy status` to track the status of the test run. Once it completes, you
can inspect the logs using `sonobuoy logs` and/or retrieve it using `sonobuoy retrieve`
to copy from the main Sonobuoy pod to a local directory.
