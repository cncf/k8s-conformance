## Run conformance tests using sonobuoy CLI

k8s version info

```
[root@k8s01]# kubectl version
Client Version: v1.30.2
Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
Server Version: v1.30.2
```

```bash
[root@k8s01]# ./sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance 
````

You can monitor the conformance tests by tracking the sonobuoy logs. Wait for the line `no-exit was specified, sonobuoy is now blocking`, which signals the end of the testing.

```bash
[root@k8s01]# ./sonobuoy logs -f
```

To view actively running pods:
```bash
[root@k8s01]# ./sonobuoy status
```
Example:
```bash
[root@k8s01]# ./sonobuoy status 
          PLUGIN     STATUS   RESULT   COUNT                                PROGRESS
            e2e   complete   passed       1   Passed:402, Failed:  0, Remaining:  0
   systemd-logs   complete   passed       3                                        

Sonobuoy has completed. Use `sonobuoy retrieve` to get results.
```

Upon completion of the tests you can obtain the results by copying them off the sonobuoy pod.

```bash
[root@k8s01]# ./sonobuoy retrieve
```
