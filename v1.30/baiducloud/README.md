After successful login, select “Product Services > Container Engine CCE” and enter the “Cluster Management > Cluster List” page. 

The “Cluster List” page will display all the created CCE cluster name/ID, status, region and other information and users can search the cluster through the cluster name. Please select and switch the region according to the actual needs.

#### Run Conformance Test

On one of the Kubernetes worker node, run command as below:

```
go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy

sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance

sonobuoy status

sonobuoy logs

```

Wait for around 60 minutes for the test to be finished, the log will show something like `no-exit was specified, sonobuoy is now blocking` to indicate that the test has been finished, then run the following command to extract the test results.

```
sonobuoy retrieve .

mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results

```
