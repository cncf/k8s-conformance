# Conformance tests for Scaleway's Kubernetes

## Setup the Scaleway Kubernetes cluster

We'll use the [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli/) to create the cluster. Please be sure to have at least version `v2.32.1`.
Once the CLI is configured (typing `scw init` and following the questions), you can type:

```bash
scw k8s cluster create cni=calico name=conformance pools.0.name=default pools.0.size=2 pools.0.node-type=dev1_l version=1.30.2 --wait
```

Once the command returns, install the Kubeconfig by typing:

```bash
scw k8s kubeconfig install <id-of-the-cluster>
```

## Run Conformance Test

1. Download a binary release of [sonobuoy](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/releases), or install it using go:

    ```bash
    go install github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy@v0.57.1
    ```

2. Run sonobuoy:

    ```bash
    sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance
    ```

3. Check the status:

    ```bash
    sonobuoy status
    ```

4. Once the status shows the run as completed, you can download the results archive by running:

    ```bash
    sonobuoy retrieve
    ```
