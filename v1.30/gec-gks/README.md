To create the cluster:

You will need an account for our OpenStack platform Optimist and get the kubeconfig for your cluster in our Kubernetes platform GKSv3.

Please email sales@german-edge-cloud.io and ask for a new account credentials for Optimist and for a GKSv3 cluster. You will receive the kubeconfig once we have created the customized GKSv3 cluster running in v1.30.


You can download the kubeconfig details and you will be able to set KUBECONFIG

```
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig-admin-<CLUSTERID>
```

If you have any issues please email support@german-edge-cloud.io
