## To reproduce:

This Kubernetes conformance report is generated by [DKP](https://docs.d2iq.com/dkp).

### Provision the Kubernetes cluster

To recreate these results, you need to provision a Kubernetes cluster using NKP.
To do so, please run the following command:

```bash
$ nkp create cluster aws --cluster-name=cncf-conformance --with-aws-bootstrap-credentials=true --self-managed
```

### Run conformance tests

Tests are run according to the [official instructions](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/instructions.md):
* download latest version of sonobuoy
* `sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance`
* `sonobuoy retrieve`
* `sonobuoy delete`

### Clean-up

To delete the entire infrastructure, please run the following command:

```bash
$ nkp delete cluster --cluster-name=cncf-conformance --self-managed
```
