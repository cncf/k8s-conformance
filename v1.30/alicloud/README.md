# How to Reproduce

## Create a managed Kubernetes cluster

### Prerequisites

---------

ACK, Elastic Scaling Service (ESS), and Resource Access Management
(RAM) are activated.

Log on to the [ACK console](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/), [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/), and [ESS console](https://essnew.console.aliyun.com) to activate these services.

**Note**

When you create a Kubernetes cluster, we recommend that you
follow these rules:

* Your account balance must be no less than CNY 100 and you must complete the real-name verification. Otherwise, you cannot create pay-as-you-go Elastic Compute Service (ECS) or Server Load Balancer (SLB) instances.

* SLB instances created along with the cluster support only the pay-as-you-go billing method.

* Kubernetes clusters support only VPC networks.

* By default, each account has specific quotas on the amount of cloud resources that can be created. You cannot create clusters if the quota limit has been exceeded. Make sure that you have sufficient quotas before you create a cluster. To request a quota increase, [submit a ticket](https://selfservice.console.aliyun.com/ticket/scene/ecs/%E4%BA%91%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8%20ECS/detail).
  * You can create up to 50 clusters across all regions for each account. A pro cluster can contain up to 2400 nodes. To create more clusters or nodes, submit a ticket.
    **Note** In a Kubernetes cluster, you can create up to 48 route entries for the VPC network where the cluster is deployed. To increase the maximum number of route entries that you can create, submit a ticket.
  * You can create up to 100 security groups for each account.
  
  * You can create up to 60 pay-as-you-go SLB instances for each account.
  
  * You can create up to 20 Elastic IP addresses (EIPs) for each account.

### Procedure

Flannel offers a few simple features and does not support standard Kubernetes network policies.* Terway: a network plug-in developed by Alibaba Cloud Container Service. Terway allows you to assign Alibaba Cloud Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) to containers. It also allows you to customize network policies of Kubernetes to control intercommunication among containers, and implement bandwidth throttling on individual containers. **Note** The number of pods supported by a node depends on the number of ENIs that are attached to the node and the number of secondary IP addresses provided by these ENIs. |
      | **Pod CIDR Block**        | If you set Network Plug-in to **Flannel** , the **Pod CIDR Block** parameter is available. The CIDR block specified by **Pod CIDR Block** cannot overlap with the CIDR blocks that are used by the VPC network or existing clusters in the VPC network. After you create the cluster, you cannot modify the pod CIDR block. In addition, the service CIDR block cannot overlap with the pod CIDR block. For more information, see [Plan Kubernetes CIDR blocks under a VPC](t16651.html#concept-izq-sg4-vdb).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
      | **Terway Mode**           | If you set Network Plug-in to **Terway** , the **Terway Mode** parameter is available. When you set **Terway Mode** , you can select or clear **Assign One ENI to Each Pod** .  *If you select this check box, an ENI will be assigned to each pod.* If you clear this check box, an ENI will be shared among multiple pods. A secondary IP address of the ENI will be assigned to each pod.   **Note** This feature is only available to users in the whitelist.
