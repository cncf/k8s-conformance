# RKE Government
A Kubernetes distribution focused on enabling Federal government compliance-based use cases. Also known as rke2.

## To Reproduce

1. Create two machines, any modern Linux will work. This test was done on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4 LTS.
2. RKE2 provides an installation script that is a convenient way to install it as a service on systemd or openrc based systems. To install RKE2 using this method, run the below. Note that rke2 provides a built-in ingress controller that should be disabled when running conformance tests as it will interfere with "[sig-network] Ingress API should support creating Ingress API operations [Conformance]":
  ```
  mkdir -p /etc/rancher/rke2 && cat <<EOF > /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml
  disable: rke2-ingress-nginx
  token: test
  EOF
  
  curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sudo INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=v1.30.0+rke2r1 sh -
  systemctl enable rke2-server
  systemctl start rke2-server
  ```
3. To install on worker nodes and add them to the cluster, create a config file with token and server entries. Here is an example showing how to join a worker node. The value to use for token is stored at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/node-token on your server node, or just the value supplied to the token arg when starting your server node, as shown in the example above.
  ```
  mkdir -p /etc/rancher/rke2 && cat <<EOF > /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml
  server: https://serverone:9345
  token: test
  EOF
  
  curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sudo INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=v1.30.0+rke2r1 INSTALL_RKE2_TYPE='agent' sh -
  systemctl enable rke2-agent
  systemctl start rke2-agent
  ```
4. Run sonobuoy v0.57.1: `sonobuoy run --plugin-env=e2e.E2E_EXTRA_ARGS="--non-blocking-taints=node-role.kubernetes.io/controller --ginkgo.v" --mode=certified-conformance --kubernetes-version=v1.30.0 --kubeconfig=/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml`
