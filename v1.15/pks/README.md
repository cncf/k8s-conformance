# Pivotal Container Service v1.6
Pivotal Container Service (PKS) provides both cloud and on-prem Kubernetes as a service.
## Installing PKS
To get started, follow the guide [here](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks). The guide includes instructions on how to provision and manage the PKS control plane.
## Creating a Kubernetes Cluster
```
pks create-cluster CLUSTER-NAME -e HOSTNAME -p PLAN_NAME
pks get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME
```
## Running Conformance Tests
The standard tool for running these tests is
[Sonobuoy](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy).  Sonobuoy is
regularly built and kept up to date to execute against all
currently supported versions of kubernetes.

Download a [binary release](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy/releases) of the CLI, or build it yourself by running:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy
```

Deploy a Sonobuoy pod to your cluster with:

```
$ sonobuoy run
```

View actively running pods:

```
$ sonobuoy status
```

To inspect the logs:

```
$ sonobuoy logs
```

Once `sonobuoy status` shows the run as `completed`, copy the output directory from the main Sonobuoy pod to
a local directory:

```
$ sonobuoy retrieve .
```

This copies a single `.tar.gz` snapshot from the Sonobuoy pod into your local
`.` directory. Extract the contents into `./results` with:

```
mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results
```

**NOTE:** The two files required for submission are located in the tarball under **plugins/e2e/results/{e2e.log,junit.xml}**.

To clean up Kubernetes objects created by Sonobuoy, run:

```
sonobuoy delete
```
